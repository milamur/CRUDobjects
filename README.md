# README

This is my Rails application for the CRUD assignment. The first object lets the user enter the name of their online class, indicate whether they have assignments due, and record the number of hours the class meets per week. The second object lets the user enter the names, contact information, and attendance status of themselves or other students in the online class. 

Ethan couldn't get Bootstrap to work on his PC, so instead the second CRUD object described above was added. The root index has been changed, and two validations — both validating the presence — are included as well. 

* Ruby version 6.0.0

* System dependencies

* Uses SQLite
